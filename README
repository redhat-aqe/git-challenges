What is this thing?
===================

This is a self-service git workshop full of tasks and challenges that should
teach you to work with some of the more interesting git commands useful during
code reviews and refactoring

All challenges are in numbered sub-directories. Each has a README file
describing the challenge and there is also a "solution" branch were README
file contains the steps to complete the challenge. You can see it by running
"git show solution".

Challenges with higher numbers can occasionally require knowledge of lower-numbered
challenges, but feel free to explore as you wish

Prerequisites:
 * Basic knowledge/experience with some git commands
     * git log
     * git show
     * git add 
     * git commit
     * git stash
     * git reset
     * (maybe a few more)
 * Thirst for knowledge

Before starting your challenges you have to run:
    git submodule update --init

Have fun!
